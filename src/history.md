0.1.0 (2024-05-26)
------------------

* First release on PyPI.
* I have just created this project to participate in the 3rd edition of the ecoCode challenge.
* I like contributing to this project that I have been following since its beginning.
* The objectives of this project are to share as many Python scripts as possible that we can use to test the eco-responsibility rules written in Sonarqub and also to test the profiling tools that we will study during this 3rd edition.
