PythonProfilingCode
-------------------
I have just created this project to participate in the 3rd edition of the ecoCode challenge.
I like contributing to this project that I have been following since its beginning.
The objectives of this project are to share as many Python scripts as possible that we can use to test
the eco-responsibility rules written in Sonarqub and also to test the profiling tools that
we will study during this 3rd edition.
